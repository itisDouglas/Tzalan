# Tzalan

A static site generator made with Rust. Created by Douglas Cueva Jr.

## About

Tzalan, a word from the language Nawat, meaning *in between*, describing the function of a basic static site generator (SSG). 

This project was made to learn Rust while using it. There's also the intention to allow others to learn from this project, and how to create an SSG.
